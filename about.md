The idea of Calamares arose from a desire of several independent Linux distributions to come together and work on a shared system installer. Instead of everyone working on their own implementation and forking forks of forks, why not work together on something that can be used by many?

## What is Calamares
{: .offset}

Calamares is an installer framework. By design it is very customizable, in order to satisfy a wide variety of needs and use cases.

Calamares aims to be easy, usable, beautiful, pragmatic, inclusive and distribution-agnostic.

Calamares includes an advanced partitioning feature, with support for both manual and automated partitioning operations. It is the first installer with an automated "Replace Partition" option, which makes it easy to reuse a partition over and over for distribution testing.

Got a Linux distribution but no system installer? [Grab Calamares](https://github.com/calamares/calamares){:target="_blank"}, mix and match any number of [Calamares modules](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/tree/calamares/src/modules){:target="_blank"} (or write your own in Python or C++), throw together some [branding](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/tree/calamares/src/branding){:target="_blank"}, package it up and you are ready to ship!
The [Calamares extensions](https://github.com/calamares/calamares-extensions){:target="_blank"}
repository holds more branding examples and specialized modules.

## What Calamares is not
{: .offset}

Calamares is not an installer for any specific Linux distribution.
It is **used** by Manjaro and KaOS and Maui and Netrunner Linux,
but it isn't "the Manjaro installer".
Calamares is an independent product.
The Calamares team works closely with Linux distributors to provide the
very best experience to their users.

Calamares does not aim to be the ultimate "standard" installer of the Linux
desktop. Many distributions already have more mature system installer
solutions, but some don't, and that's where Calamares can be of use.
A herd of Arch derivatives uses Calamares, as does a family of Debian and
Ubuntu spins, Fedora remixes and openSUSE flavors.


## What does Calamares look like
{: .offset}

Since Calamares is designed to be customized, themed and branded by individual distributions,
it [can look very different](/#gallery) when used by specific distributions. There will be distinct
color schemes, welcome graphics, and while-you-wait slideshows.
It is very unlikely that you will encounter a "plain" version of Calamares.
The source code **does** have a default configuration, which looks like these
screenshots:

## Who develops Calamares
{: .offset}

Calamares is maintained by [the Calamares team](/team/). Most of us are also [KDE](https://kde.org){:target="_blank"} developers, and we have received contributions from [BBQLinux](http://bbqlinux.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/){:target="_blank"}, [KaOS](http://kaosx.us/){:target="_blank"}, [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org){:target="_blank"}, [Manjaro](http://manjaro.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Maui](http://www.maui-project.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Netrunner](http://www.netrunner.com/){:target="_blank"} and [OpenMandriva](https://www.openmandriva.org/){:target="_blank"} developers as well.

We gladly accept contributions from everyone, and we have no exclusive association with any Linux distribution. Calamares is not a KDE project, or a KaOS project, or a Manjaro project, we are just a bunch of people dumping some code on [GitHub](https://github.com/calamares){:target="_blank"}.

## What is Calamares made of
{: .offset}

Calamares is mostly written in C++17, with Qt 5 (5.9 or later) as general
purpose library and UI toolkit.

Calamares is modular by design, and Python 3 was chosen as the main
scripting language. The Python 3 interface is implemented with Boost.Python,
and all Calamares configuration is done in YAML.

For a complete list of dependencies, see
[the README file](https://github.com/calamares/calamares/blob/calamares/README.md){:target="_blank"}.
